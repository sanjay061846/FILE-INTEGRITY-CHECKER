DESCRIPTION
A File Integrity Checker is a security-based application designed to ensure that files have not been altered, modified, or tampered with without authorization. In today’s digital world, maintaining the integrity of files is very important, especially in areas like cybersecurity, data protection, and system administration. This project focuses on developing a File Integrity Checker using Python, which can be easily executed using Python IDLE.

The main objective of this project is to detect changes in files by using cryptographic hash functions. A hash function converts file data into a fixed-length value known as a hash. Even a very small change in a file will produce a completely different hash value. By comparing hash values before and after, the program can identify whether a file has been modified.

In this project, Python’s built-in and standard libraries such as hashlib and os are used. The hashlib library provides secure hash algorithms like SHA-256, which is widely used due to its strong security features. The program reads a file in binary mode and generates a hash value. This hash value is stored securely for future comparison.

The project works in two main phases.
In the initial phase, the user selects a file, and the program calculates its hash value. This hash is saved in a separate file or displayed to the user. This hash acts as the original reference value of the file.
In the verification phase, the program recalculates the hash of the same file at a later time and compares it with the previously stored hash. If both hash values match, the file is considered unchanged and secure. If the hash values do not match, the program alerts the user that the file has been modified or corrupted.

The entire application is developed and executed using Python IDLE, which makes it beginner-friendly. IDLE provides a simple interface for writing, running, and testing Python programs. This allows students to easily understand the logic, debug errors, and observe output without requiring advanced development tools.

This File Integrity Checker has several real-world applications. It can be used to protect important documents, detect malware attacks, verify downloaded files, and monitor system files
for unauthorized changes. Organizations often use similar tools to maintain data integrity and system security.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how Python can be effectively used to build a practical cybersecurity tool. The File Integrity Checker enhances understanding of hashing algorithms, file handling, and security concepts. It is a valuable learning project for students interested in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and software security, and it can be successfully implemented using Python IDLE with minimal system requirements.
